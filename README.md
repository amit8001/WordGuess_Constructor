# constructor-word_guess_game
This is a working version of the Word guess coded using constructors.</br>
You can try to guess a word by typing in letters each time</br>
You have total 15 guesses to guess a word</br>
If you have correctly guessed a letter, typing it again will not lower your "attempts remaining" counter! </br>
If within 15 guesses, you are not able to guess the word, then you are give the option to play again and guess another random word!
